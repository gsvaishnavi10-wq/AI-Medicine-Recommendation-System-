1. Project Overview
The AI Medicine Recommendation System is a web-based application designed to suggest suitable medicines based on user-provided symptoms. The system uses a predefined CSV dataset that contains symptoms and corresponding medicine details. By using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project provides a simple interface where users can enter symptoms and receive instant medicine recommendations. This project demonstrates the application of artificial intelligence logic in healthcare using web technologies.
2. Problem Statement
Many people face difficulty in identifying basic medicines for common health problems such as fever, cold, headache, and cough. Visiting a doctor for minor issues may not always be possible due to time, cost, or accessibility constraints. There is a need for a simple system that can guide users by recommending basic medicines for minor symptoms using available medical data.
3. Objectives
To develop a user-friendly medicine recommendation system
To recommend medicines based on symptoms entered by the user
To store and manage medical data using a CSV dataset
To implement AI-like decision logic using JavaScript
To create a browser-based application without hardware dependency
4. Technologies Used
HTML – For creating the structure of the web page
CSS – For designing and styling the user interface
JavaScript – For implementing logic and processing data
CSV Dataset – For storing symptoms and medicine information
Web Browser – For running the application
5. How It Works
The user enters or selects a symptom in the web interface
JavaScript reads the CSV dataset
The system matches the user symptom with dataset values
The corresponding medicine is identified
The recommended medicine is displayed on the screen
6.Project Status
Day 1
The project topic was selected. The problem statement and objectives were defined, and the overall project plan was prepared.
Day 2
Information about common symptoms and medicines was collected. A CSV dataset was created to store symptom and medicine details.
Day 3
The user interface was designed using HTML. Input fields and buttons were created for user interaction.
Day 4
The webpage was styled using CSS. The layout and visual appearance were improved for better usability.
Day 5
JavaScript logic was implemented. The CSV dataset was read and user symptoms were matched with the appropriate medicines.
Day 6
All components including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the CSV dataset were integrated. The application was tested with different inputs.
Day 7
